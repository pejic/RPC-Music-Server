                           ************************

1. INTRODUCTION

RPCMusic is for controlling volumes and a music player from the lan using a
browser.  Currently only Amarok over a DBus connection and alsa are supported.

2. USAGE

The server is run manually from the command line (in the X11 session with your
music player) as follows:

$ rpcmusic_install_dir/rpcMusicServer.pl

Now point your browser to http://localhost:8222/ to control your volume and
music.

If you would like to run the server as a daemon just add the '-d' flag as
follows:

$ rpcmusic_install_dir/rpcMusicServer.pl -d

3. CONFIGURATION

3a. Styles

The default style is set in rpcMusic.html by setting all stylesheets as
alternate except the default one.  The styles are purely controlled via CSS, so
it should be fairly easy to make changes to existing ones or make your own from
scratch.

3b. Mixers

The mixer configuration file is located at ~/.rpcmusic.conf.  The configuration
format is similar to the apache configuration format.  Each mixer's
configuration looks as follows:

<Card MIXER_NAME>
  Card CARD_NUMBER
  Mixer CARD_MIXER
</Card>

MIXERNAME is the display name of the mixer (anything you like).  CARD_NUMBER is
the integer corresponding to the alsa card (e.g. 0).  CARD_MIXER is the alsa
mixer name (e.g. Master).  You may have multiple Mixer lines, and RPC Music
Server will average across them.

For a sample configuration see sampleconfig.conf.

3c. Port

The default port is 8222 and can be configured in ~/.rpcmusic.conf which uses
the apache config syntax.  The port is configured using the Port directive:

Port	8222

See sampleconfig.conf for a sample configuration file.

4. KNOWN ISSUES and LIMITATIONS

- A fairly recent browser is required to support the styles properly.
- The DBus server must be running prior to running the rpcMusicServer.pl.
