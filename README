                           ************************

1. INTRODUCTION

RPCMusic is for controlling volumes and a music player from the lan using a
browser.  Currently only Amarok over a DBus connection and alsa are supported.

2. USAGE

The server is run manually from the command line (in the X11 session with your
music player) as follows:

$ cd rpcmusic/
$ ./rpcMusicServer.pl

Now point your browser to http://localhost:8222/ to control your volumes and
music.

3. CONFIGURATION

3a. Styles

The default style is set in rpcMusic.html by setting all stylesheets as
alternate except the default one.  The styles are purely controlled via CSS, so
it should be fairly easy to make changes to existing ones or make your own from
scratch.

3b. Mixers

To choose which mixers are shown edit rpcMusicServer.pl's CONFIG section near
the top.  If multiple mixers are exposed as one control then their average is
taken.  The name may be anything you like, but the card and mixers parameters
must match your desired mixers.

4. KNOWN ISSUES and LIMITATIONS

- A fairly recent browser is required to support the styles properly, although
  the functionality is not broken.
- The DBus server must be running prior to running the rpcMusicServer.pl.
- Amarok must be running while launching rpcMusicServer.pl.
- The server makes no attempt to filter connections from the internet.
